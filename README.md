## Sending-email-using-AWS-services
In this project, initially I created a S3 Bucket and Lambda function later using IAM created role which gives full access to S3 bucket,Cloud Watch,Amazon SES. Using Amazon SES email is verified to which we are sending. Later on triggering event in Lambda was done and deployed using python code. So whenever we upload any files to bucket then we will get the notification through email that whatever changes or uploads happened to bucket. 
This project involves Amazon S3 Bucket, AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, Amazon SES, Amazon Cloud Watch.
